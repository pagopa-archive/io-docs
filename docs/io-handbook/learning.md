### Internal workshops

We periodically run short internal workshop sessions to facilitate knowledge sharing between us.
Subject may vary: they can be about explaining some new domain concepts in IO as well as share with other the use of a specific technology or introducing new features in our common tools.

In few words: anything you think your colleagues can benefit from.

#### How to organize a workshop

- Take the initiative: propose yourself to run a workshop. Alternatively, ask a colleague of yours to do that if you think she/he knows something worth sharing.
- Once scheduled, create a public calendar event and share it. Post the link to the event on `#team_tech` channel
- Define in advance an agenda with what you are going to share. You can use [Fellow](https://pagopa.fellow.app) for that.
- Come prepared: take the right time to prepare slide/code/sandboxes in advance. Consider assign yourself a story on the issue tracker _(example: Plan typescript workshop)_.

#### How to run a workshop

- Record the presentation so anyone can enjoy it later. Please refer to [our guidelines for video recording](https://github.com/pagopa/io-handbook/blob/master/communication.md#video-recordings).

#### How to share the content of a workshop

- Upload the video recording into [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1sqSQ7qnqvtDte8joCWziYmTRWmKd7fdt). Name files in the format `YYYYMMDD - title.videoFormat` _(example: 20201013 - Typesctript.mp4)_.
- If you have slides to share, upload them with the name `YYYYMMDD - title.videoFormat.slideFormat` _(example: 20201013 - Typesctript.mp4.md)_.
- Add a reference into the [learning wiki page](https://sites.google.com/pagopa.it/io-wiki/io-home/learning).
