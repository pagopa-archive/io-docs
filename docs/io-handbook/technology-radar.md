title: Technology Radar
---

The Radar is an ever evolving document that describes what we find interesting
and useful in the software development practice - these are mostly things
that we should consider using in our projects. The Radar it's inspired by
[Thoughtworks Technology Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar).

The Radar is structured around four main themes: Techniques, Tools, Platforms,
Languages & Frameworks.

Each theme describes [trends and topics](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/a-z) grouped in four rings:

1. Adopt: mature, you should definitely use it in your production projects
1. Trial: suitable for early adoption in projects that can bare some risk
1. Assess: not ready yet for production use, should be used in PoCs or side projects
1. Hold: these are usually over hyped or reaching the end of their life, try to avoid
